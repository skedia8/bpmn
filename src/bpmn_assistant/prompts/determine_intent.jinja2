{{ message_history }}

---

Based on this message history, determine whether the last user message indicates that the user wants to:
1. Make a modification to the process or create a new process.
2. Ask for information or make conversation.

Example messages where the user wants to make a modification or create a new process:
- a literal description of the process
- "Create this process: [description of the process]"
- "Build this: [description of the process]"
- "Remove the task where the manager needs to approve the budget."
- "Add a parallel gateway before the task to check the budget."
- "Change the order of the last two tasks."
- "Then change it."
- "The process consists of the manager approving the budget, then the task to check the budget, and finally the task to create the report."
- "After entering the grade, the professor should be notified."
- "Visualize this process: [description of the process]"

Example messages where the user is asking for information or making conversation:
- "Hello"
- "Can you describe the process?"
- "What happens after the task to check the budget?"
- "I don't understand what happens in that big exclusive gateway after the first task."
- "Tell me more about that event."
- "Can you help me create a new process?"
- "I will explain the process to you, and you will then visualize it, ok?"

Your response will be in the form of a JSON object with a single key, "intent", which will have the value "modify" if the user wants to make a modification or create a new process, or "talk" if the user is asking for information or making conversation.

```json
{
    "intent": "modify",
}
```

Response if the user is asking for information or making conversation:
